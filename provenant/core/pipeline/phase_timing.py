"""Phase-timing recorder for the indexing pipeline.

A ``ProgressCallback`` decorator that observes ``on_phase_start`` /
``on_phase_done`` events and records the wall-clock duration of each
phase. Designed to compose with the real (Rich / Logging) callback so
the timing data is collected without touching pipeline internals.

The CLI writes the resulting ``timings`` dict into ``state.json`` so
before/after perf comparisons across runs become trivial:

.. code-block:: text

    state.json
    {
      "last_sync_commit": "...",
      "phase_timings": {
        "traverse": 4.21,
        "parse": 88.3,
        "graph.imports": 312.5,
        ...
      }
    }

class PhaseTimingRecorder:
    """Observes pipeline phase events and records wall-clock durations.

    Wraps another ``ProgressCallback`` (or ``None``) and transparently
    delegates every call. Concurrent / nested phases are supported -
    each phase name is timed independently from its own
    ``on_phase_start`` to its matching ``on_phase_done``.

    Repeated phases (a phase whose ``on_phase_start`` fires more than
    once in a single run) accumulate; the total is the sum of every
    visit. This matches how the user perceives the cost - "how much
    wall-clock time did this phase consume".
