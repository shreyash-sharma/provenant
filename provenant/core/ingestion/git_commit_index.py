"""Single-pass repo-wide commit index for git_indexer.

The original per-file path in ``git_indexer._index_file`` spawned one
``git log --numstat`` subprocess per tracked file. On a 5,000-file repo
that meant 5,000 process spawns — ~50–100 ms each on Windows — which
made the git phase dominate the total ``provenant init`` wall-clock.

This module replaces the fan-out with one repo-wide ``git log`` pass
and an in-memory bucketing step. The shape mirrors what
``_compute_co_changes`` already does — one subprocess, fan-out via
Python dicts — so any future debugging only has one log format to
understand.

The batched path is only used when ``follow_renames=False`` (the
default). Rename-tracking still falls back to the per-file ``--follow``
path because git's rename heuristics are evaluated against a single
input file, not retro-fittable from a repo-wide log.

    Returns a dict mapping ``file_path → [commit records, newest first]``.
    Files with no commits in the window simply aren't present in the
