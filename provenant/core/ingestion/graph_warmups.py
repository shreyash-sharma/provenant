"""Per-language warmup hooks that run before the graph-import phase.

Some languages (notably C# / .NET) need an expensive one-time index
built before any per-file import can be resolved. When that build runs
lazily on first import resolution, the progress bar appears frozen for
many minutes mid-phase and the cost is silently absorbed into
``graph.imports`` timing — making it indistinguishable from real
import-resolution work.

This module gives each language a place to declare a *warmup* function
that runs in its own phase event (``graph.<lang>_index``), before the
``graph.imports`` loop starts. Warmups are gated on whether any
parsed file actually uses the language, so a Python-only repo never
pays a Java index cost.

Adding a new language's warmup is one entry in :data:`_WARMUPS`.
Implementations live in the language's resolver subpackage so this
module stays language-agnostic.
