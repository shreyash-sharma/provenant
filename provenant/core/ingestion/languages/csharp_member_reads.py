"""C# member-access read resolution.

Background
----------
Property reads in C# never appear as calls — ``var x = new Order();``
followed by ``return x.Total;`` produces a ``member_access_expression``
but no invocation. The existing static-call resolver and ``using``
import resolver both miss this entirely, which makes any class whose
only consumers READ its properties read as orphaned.

This pass closes the biggest sub-case without touching the brittle
tree-sitter grammar:

1. **Local-typed receivers** — ``var x = new Foo(...);`` plus
   ``Foo x = new(...);`` plus ``Foo x = ...;`` declare a local whose
   type we know syntactically. Subsequent ``x.SomeMember`` reads in
   the same file resolve to the file that declares ``Foo``.

2. **``this.PropName``** — the receiver is the enclosing class.
   When the file declares exactly one named type (the dominant case
   for C#), ``this.Prop`` reads resolve to that file. Cross-file
   resolution would require partial-class awareness; we skip it for
   safety.

The resolved file becomes a low-confidence ``reads`` edge. Dead-code
treats every incoming edge as evidence of life, so this directly
reduces unused_export false positives without affecting other
analyses. ``reads`` is a new edge type — ``calls`` / ``imports`` /
``type_use`` remain unchanged so semantics-aware consumers can tell
them apart.

The module is **self-contained**: it reads source text directly,
runs a few regexes, and emits dicts. It does not depend on the parser
or the call resolver, which keeps the pass isolated and easy to gate
behind a feature flag if it ever proves noisy.
