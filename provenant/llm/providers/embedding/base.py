"""Embedder protocol and implementations for provenant vector search.

The Embedder protocol is structural (runtime_checkable) so any object with
an `embed()` method and a `dimensions` property satisfies it without
inheriting from a base class.

MockEmbedder is the built-in test implementation: deterministic, 8-dimensional,
zero external dependencies.
